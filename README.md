# CS Internal Assessment  

This page is dedicated to my CS IA, which I completed during the IB program. Here, you can find all relevant files or links to referenced documents.  

However, the setup of this repository and website does not exactly match how an IA should be submitted.  

Below, I’ve listed the modifications I made to adapt my IA for online hosting.  

For details on IA structure, visit the [Resource Center](https://bprzybylski.github.io/IB-CS-GeS/).  

## List of Changes  
1. **Source Code** – Instead of uploading the code directly, I provided a **GitHub link** to the version submitted for my IA. *(The code has since been updated, but the IA version remains accessible.)*  
2. **Video Demonstration** – Rather than uploading a large file, I included a **YouTube link** showcasing the final product.  
3. **File Name** – I renamed the main website file from `cover_page.htm` to `index.html` _(to enable proper hosting)._
